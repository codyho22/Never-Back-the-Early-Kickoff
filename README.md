# Never-Back-the-Early-Kickoff
A research project investigating whether or not the saying "Never Back the Early Kickoff" has any validity

"Never Back the Early": A very common saying in Fantasy soccer/football, suggesting that games played at the early kickoff are more unpredictable than games at later times, ie more upsets happen. The early kickoff is 
noontime (local time of the game), so a kickoff between 12:00 pm and 12:45 pm
